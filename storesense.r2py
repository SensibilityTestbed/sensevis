<Purpose>
  This is a library for POSTing sensor data to a
  website (sensevis.poly.edu) for backhauling.

Example Use:
  # In your program, import this library:
  dy_import_module_symbols('storesense.r2py')

  data = []
  measurements = {}
  
  # Collect some data...
  for x in range(0, 10):
    measurements['gps'] = getLocation()
    measurements['speed'] = getSpeed()
    measurements['fuel_level'] = getFuelLevel()
    measurements['fuel_consumption'] = getFuelConsumption()
    # Each data entry requires a timestamp for the POST to succeed.
    data.appends(storesense_timestamp(measurements))

  storesense_post(data, 'mycollection', 'myusername')

  <Purpose>
    POSTs sensor data to a website (sensevis.poly.edu) where it

    data:
        A list of sensor data entries (dicts) to be POSTed.
    collection:
