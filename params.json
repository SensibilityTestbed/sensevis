{"name":"SenseVis","tagline":"A cloud storage and data visualization service for Sensibility Testbed.","body":"``Being able to collect anonymous sensor data from several smartphones simultaneously makes [Sensibility Testbed](sensibilitytestbed.com) a powerful tool for experimenters. However, aggregating this data can be complex or cumbersome when an experimenter is expected to manage their own database. Having the data they collect be stored in a central location with easy access is desirable to experimenters.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, experimenters using the Sensibility Testbed platform want to interact with their data in a natural way. Even for the savvy experimenter who is well acquainted with doing this themselves, creating new visualizations for each set of data in each of their experiments can get in the way of the most important part of the process: analyzing the results. Enter SenseVis.\r\n\r\nSenseVis is a website giving experimenters not only a central location to aggregate and store sensor data from a multitude of smartphones, but also multiple options for visualizing data. It's the sort of offloading experimenters want from a platform like Sensibility Testbed, and exactly what they're getting.\r\n\r\n### Where We Are Now\r\nStill in development, SenseVis currently provides two visualization options: tables and Google Maps (for location-based data), with more to come.\r\n\r\n### How to Get Started\r\nCheck out the [Readme] (https://github.com/smmiller/sensevis/blob/master/README.md).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
